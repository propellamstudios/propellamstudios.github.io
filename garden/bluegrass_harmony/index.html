            <h2 id="what-is-bluegrass-harmony">What is bluegrass harmony?</h2>
<p>Bluegrass harmony singing is a type of &lsquo;close harmony&rsquo; singing that has been part of the bluegrass tradition dating back to Bill Monroe up through today. It is usually a three-part (occasionally four-part) harmony, with one singer singing above the lead or melody, and the other singer singing below the lead, although there are other variations to this type of arrangement. When a well-matched set of voices are singing in full harmony on a bluegrass song, it can be a really beautiful experience! This app will help you learn the terminology and also some of the music theory behind bluegrass harmony singing, so you can understand how these parts are arranged, and potentially create your own arrangements. More importantly, this app is meant to help you practice singing in harmony, and to get used to how the different parts are supposed to fit together.</p>
<h2 id="terminology">Terminology</h2>
<p>Some of the terminology used to describe bluegrass harmony singing can be a bit confusing, since some of the terms are used differently in choral music; the differences will be explained in each section below.</p>
<h3 id="stack">Stack</h3>
<p>The &lsquo;stack&rsquo; describes the particular arrangement of parts for a song. The most typical stack is a three-part harmony arrangement with the lead, tenor, and baritone parts, but there are other types of stacks that can be used as well, depending on the vocal ranges of the singers involved.</p>
<h3 id="lead">Lead</h3>
<p>The lead singer is the person who sings the melody of the song. Usually, this person is the only one singing the verses of a song, although there are some songs that have harmony through the entire song, verse and chorus. More typically, though, the other two (sometimes three) harmony singers will only join in on the chorus.</p>
<p>It is helpful if the lead singer has a strong voice and can project; even though the beauty of harmony singing comes from the addition of the other singers to the lead, the main melody should still come through to the audience. If the lead singer is not a particularly strong singer, the other singers who are harmonizing should make sure to not overpower them.</p>
<h3 id="tenor">Tenor</h3>
<p>The tenor part is the higher harmony part that goes &ldquo;above&rdquo; the melody. It is usually pitched a third or fourth interval above the melody line, depending on which note fits with whatever chord is occurring in the chord progression at that moment. This usage in bluegrass is different from choral music, where &rsquo;tenor&rsquo; refers to the highest male vocal range. In bluegrass, the tenor part can be sung by either a man or a woman, the only requirement is that the tenor part is higher pitched and sung above the lead/melody.</p>
<p>Bluegrass musicians who are notable for singing the tenor part include Curly Seckler when singing with Flatt and Scruggs, or Ricky Skaggs when singing with Tony Rice.</p>
<h3 id="baritone">Baritone</h3>
<p>The tenor part is the lower harmony part that goes &ldquo;below&rdquo; the melody. It is usually pitched a third or fourth interval below the melody line, depending on which note fits with whatever chord is occur in the chord progression at the moment. Again, this usage in bluegrass is different from choral  music, where &lsquo;baritone&rsquo; refers to the middle male vocal range. The baritone part can be sung  by either a man or a woman, although it is a little less common for a woman to sing a straight baritone part (as opposed to a high baritone) unless the lead singer takes the melody at a somewhat higher range.</p>
<p>Bluegrass musicians who are notable for singing the baritone part include JD Crowe when singing with the New South, and Earl Scruggs when singing with Bill Monroe and the Blue Grass Boys.</p>
<h3 id="bass">Bass</h3>
<p>The bass part is not generally included in the most common stack, but when the bass part is included this singer is generally the fourth singer in the stack, and usually sings the &lsquo;root&rsquo; note in the chord progression, below the melody. Given how low the bass note usually is, the bass part is usually sung by a man.</p>
<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>
<h3 id="chords-major-and-minor">Chords: major and minor</h3>
<p>How does this work in practice? Before working through an example, let&rsquo;s quickly review what a chord is. A chord is a group of three notes that are at specific intervals in relation to each other; the particular notes of the chord depend on what key the chord is in, but the intervals between the notes are fixed, and are slight different depending on if the chord is a major chord or a minor chord.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at a G major chord and a G minor chord:</p>

<link rel="stylesheet" href=/css/hugo-easy-gallery.css />
<div class="box" style="max-width:60%">
  <figure  itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject">
    <div class="img">
      <img itemprop="thumbnail" src="/bluegrass_harmony_example_1_g_chord.jpg" alt="G major and G minor chord"/>
    </div>
    <a href="/bluegrass_harmony_example_1_g_chord.jpg" itemprop="contentUrl"></a>
  </figure>
</div>

<p>For the G major chord, the first or &ldquo;root&rdquo; note is G, the second note is B, and the third note is D. B is a third above G, and D is a fifth above G.</p>
<p>For the G minor chord, the root note again is G, the second note is Bâ™­, and the third note is D. Bâ™­ is a minor third above G, and D is a fifth above G. Note that the only difference between the major and minor chord is where the middle note is: for major chords, the middle note is a third above the root, and for minor chords, the middle note is a minor third above the root.</p>
<p>For bluegrass harmony, the harmony parts are built using the major chord.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to understand that once you know the notes that are in a particular chord, you can rearrange the notes and play them in different octaves, and it will still be considered the same chord as long as you are playing the notes in the chord. For example, let&rsquo;s look at these couple examples of how the G chord can be rearranged:</p>


<div class="box" style="max-width:60%">
  <figure  itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject">
    <div class="img">
      <img itemprop="thumbnail" src="/bluegrass_harmony_example_2_inverted_g_chord.jpg" alt="Inverted G chord"/>
    </div>
    <a href="/bluegrass_harmony_example_2_inverted_g_chord.jpg" itemprop="contentUrl"></a>
  </figure>
</div>

<p>All of these groupings are considered G chords because they all use only the notes of the G chord, even though in these examples the &lsquo;root&rsquo; note is not the lowest one. These are called &lsquo;inverted chords&rsquo;.</p>
<h3 id="arranging-harmony-parts">Arranging harmony parts</h3>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take the opening phrase of the song &ldquo;Bury Me Beneath the Willow&rdquo; in the key of D:</p>


<div class="box" style="max-width:100%">
  <figure  itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject">
    <div class="img">
      <img itemprop="thumbnail" src="/bluegrass_harmony_example_3_lead_phrase.jpg" alt="Melody for Bury Me Beneath the Willow"/>
    </div>
    <a href="/bluegrass_harmony_example_3_lead_phrase.jpg" itemprop="contentUrl"></a>
  </figure>
</div>

<p>The first two measures of the melody are in D, and then second two measures are in G. So, we know that harmony parts for the first two measures have to use notes that are in the D chord, and then for the second two measures have to use notes that are in the G chord. Other than the root, there are two other notes in the chord; the tenor part will use one of the notes, and the baritone part will use the other. How do we know which note each part will use? The simplest way is for the tenor part to pick the closest note in the chord that is &lsquo;above&rsquo; the melody note, and the baritone part picks the closest note in the chord that is &lsquo;below&rsquo; the melody note. Let&rsquo;s look at the tenor and baritone parts for the first two measures of the melody phrase; the melody will be in the middle for reference. The first two measures are in D, and the D chord has the notes D, Fâ™¯, and A, which means that the harmony parts should use those notes.</p>

<p>The melody/lead part starts on an A, which is the third and highest note of a non-inverted D chord. For the tenor part, we need to find the closest note that is &lsquo;above&rsquo; the melody note that is also in the D chord, and we find that it&rsquo;s the high D above the A. For the baritone part, we need to find the closest note that is &lsquo;below&rsquo; the melody note that is also in the D chord, and we can see that it&rsquo;s an Fâ™¯. Therefore, we have the starting notes of each of the harmony parts.</p>
<p>The melody then moves up to a quick B and then comes down to A again. What should the tenor and baritone parts do? In the melody, the &lsquo;B&rsquo; is not part of the D chord, so how do we know what the harmony parts should do?</p>
<p>The answer is that both harmony parts move up one note with the melody line and then come back to their original notes as well. Basically, the general rule is that the harmony parts should follow the contours of the melody line, especially when you are looking at melody notes that are not in the chord, e.g. &lsquo;passing notes.&rsquo; Therefore, if the melody line goes up 1 note, the harmony parts should go up one note. If the melody line goes up 2 notes, the harmony parts should go up two notes.</p>
<p>This method of following the contour of the melody in exact intervals should generally only be used for passing notes in the melody; once the melody goes back to a note that&rsquo;s in the chord, then you should use the method of finding the closest note in the chord that is above or below the melody note.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s move on to the next 2 measures. The chord progression has changed so that the chord for these two measures is G, which means that we need to find harmony notes that are part of the G chord. The G chord contains G, B, and D.</p>

<p>In measure three, the melody in on the D note, so for the tenor part, we look for the first note above that D that is in the G chord, and that note is a G. For the baritone part, we look for the first note below that D that is in the G chord, and that note is a B.</p>
<p>To sum up a general method for composing harmony parts for a melody, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Write out the melody with the chord progression for each measure.</li>
<li>First, pick out the notes of the melody that are notes that are part of that measure&rsquo;s chord; most notes should fit within the chord assigned to that measure, since the reason why that chord is the &lsquo;right&rsquo; chord for that measure is because the musical phrase in that measure uses notes from that chord.</li>
<li>For the tenor part, for each of the notes of the melody that you picked out as being part of the chord for that measure, find the closest note in that chord that is &lsquo;above&rsquo; the melody note.</li>
<li>For the baritone part, for each of the notes of the melody that are part of the chord for that measure, find the closest note in that chord that is &lsquo;below&rsquo; the melody note.</li>
<li>Then, for the passing notes in the melody, fill in each of the harmony parts by either 1) filling in the notes in the harmony part so that they follow the contour of the melody line, e.g. going up 1 note when the melody goes up 1 note, etc., or 2) filling in the notes in the harmony part so that they connect the other notes in some reasonable way.</li>
<li>Try singing the harmony part that you&rsquo;ve written so far with the melody; if it sounds good, then you&rsquo;re done! If it doesn&rsquo;t, then try adjusting the &lsquo;fill-in&rsquo; notes that were assigned to the passing notes in the melody until it does sound good. If needed, you can always forget about following the contour of the melody or other fill-in notes and just assign chord notes to the harmony parts.</li>
</ol>
<p>What about the bass part? The bass part is just the lowest root note of the chord, so for these four measures, the person singing the bass part stays on the D for the first two measures, then G for the next two measures. Note that this is a full octave below the other parts, in order avoid colliding any of the other parts.</p>

<h2 id="close-harmony">Close Harmony</h2>
<p>This style of harmony is sometimes called &ldquo;close&rdquo; harmony. This means that the harmony parts stay fairly close to the melody, and also move in the same direction as the melody, i.e. they have the same contour. This is in contrast to other styles of harmony, e.g. counterpoint, where the harmony part can jump above or below the melody, and may not follow the contour or rhythm of the melody. In bluegrass harmony, the harmony part almost always has the same rhythm as the melody, although occasionally the harmony rhythm might be simplified compared the melody, especially over passing notes.</p>
<h3 id="variations-on-normal-stack-low-tenor-and-high-baritone">Variations on &rsquo;normal&rsquo; stack: low tenor and high baritone</h3>
<p>The method for constructing harmony parts explained above will produce an arrangement for the most common stack, e.g. lead, tenor, and baritone. However, sometimes the tenor part may be too high for any of the harmony singers, and in this situation one of the harmony singers may choose to sing a &rsquo;low tenor&rsquo;, which is the tenor part transposed 1 octave down. This means that the lead singer is the highest-pitched singer in the stack, with the baritone singing below the lead and then the low tenor singing even lower, below both the lead and baritone. An example of a band who uses this type of arrangement is Alison Krauss and Union Station (e.g. on their song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DvMOIxTito">I Don&rsquo;t Know Why</a>).</p>
<p>Conversely, if the baritone part is too low for the harmony singers involved, one of the harmony singers may choose to sing a &lsquo;high baritone&rsquo;, which is the baritone part tranposed 1 octave up. Now the lead singer is the lowest-pitched singer in the stack, with the tenor singing above the lead, and the high baritone singing above both the lead and tenor. An example of a song with a high baritone is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mevmoxEsT1g">The Fields Have Turned Brown</a> by the Stanley Brothers, with Ralph Stanley singing tenor, Carter Stanley singing lead, and Darrell &ldquo;Pee Wee&rdquo; Lambert singing high baritone.</p>
<h3 id="single-harmony-part">Single harmony part</h3>
<p>Sometimes there may be only one harmony singer, instead of two. In these situations, the harmony singer usually sings tenor above the lead. This type of stack also allows for some more flexibility in the harmony part. When there are two harmony singers, the note that one harmony singer chooses to sing will generally leave only one other note for the other harmony part, since there are 3 notes in a chord and the lead/melody already takes up one note of that chord. This means that after you have written one harmony part, i.e. the tenor part, when you start writing the other harmony part, i.e. the baritone part, there is little flexibility in the notes for this part because you are left to pick the chord notes that aren&rsquo;t already being sung by the lead or tenor. Having two harmony parts singing the same note, even in different octaves, is usually avoided when possible, although there may be occasions when that is the most sensible and harmonious choice, especially if a harmony singer may not have the vocal range to reach what should be the other note in the chord.</p>
<p>However, when there is only one harmony part, these types of note collisions are not a concern, leaving the harmony singer more flexibility in terms of what note they choose to sing. Many classic &lsquo;brother&rsquo; acts in bluegrass used this type of two-part harmony, e.g. the Stanley Brothers, the Blue Sky Bows, the Louvin Brothers.</p>
<h2 id="closing-thoughts">Closing thoughts</h2>
<p>Bluegrass harmony singing can be a difficult thing to learn and do on the fly, but the best way to get better is to practice. TrioHarmony provides a way for you to learn and practice singing harmony even when you don&rsquo;t have other bluegrass jammers around.</p>
<p>Once you know your harmony part and can hit all the notes, another thing to pay attention to as a harmony singer is how the lead singer chooses their vocal phrasing for the song, and to try to match their phrasing and pronunciation as closely as possible. A really well-matched harmony stack will almost sound like one voice singing!</p>
